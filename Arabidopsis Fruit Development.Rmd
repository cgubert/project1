This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Arabidopsis thaliana has been a popular model organism for the study of genetic function due to its simplicity and full sequencing of its genome. Cell separation and organ abscission is a common biological process among plants that allows them to shed organs such as ripened fruit or dead leaves. In an effort to understand a signaling pathway involved in this process, a set mutants known to affect this process were crossed together and the resulting phenotypes were analyzed. 

Your document should layout your question in the introduction, provide a brief synopsis for why it is important, describe how you obtained the data, your general approach to analyzing the data, a summary of your results, a discussion, and mention of what your future directions would be.
